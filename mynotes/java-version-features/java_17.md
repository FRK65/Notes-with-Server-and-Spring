Here’s a theoretical overview of its key features:
---
### 1️⃣ Sealed Classes (`sealed`, `permits`)**
- Allows **restricting, class inheritance**.
- Helps to maintain **controlled hierarchies**.
- Prevents unauthorized inheritance, improving design control.
- Restricts subclassing, making code more predictable.
- Enhances security and maintainability.

### **Types of Subclasses:**
1. **`final` class** → No further extension allowed.
2. **`sealed` class** → Can restrict its own subclasses.
3. **`non-sealed` class** → Can be freely extended.

### **Benefits of Sealed Classes**
✅ Improves **encapsulation**  
✅ Prevents **unexpected subclassing**  
✅ Helps **design stable APIs**  


- Example:
  
  ```java
  public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {}
  public final class Circle extends Shape {}
  public final class Square extends Shape {}
  ```

  ```java
  public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {}
  public final class Circle extends Shape {}
  public final class Square extends Shape {}
  ```

**Here in above example :**
  
✅ `CreditCard`, `DebitCard`, and `PayPal` **must** extend `Payment`.  
✅ No other class can randomly extend `Payment`, keeping the system **secure and structured**.

### **Why Use Sealed Classes Here?**
✅ **Prevents unauthorized payment types**, ensuring **only valid payment methods** exist.  
✅ **Improves maintainability** by restricting subclass creation.  
✅ **Enhances security** by controlling inheritance.

### 2️⃣ Pattern Matching for `switch` (Preview)**
- Simplifies `switch` statements for **complex types**.
- Supports **type patterns** in `switch` expressions.

**Pattern Matching for `switch`**, introduced as a **preview feature** in **Java 17**, 
enhances the `switch` statement by allowing more flexible type checking and pattern extraction. 
This feature simplifies complex conditional logic and improves **readability** and **efficiency**.

### **🔹 Key Benefits of Pattern Matching for `switch`**
✅ Allows **`switch` to work with objects** (not just primitives and enums).  
✅ **Removes explicit casting**, making code cleaner.  
✅ Supports **type patterns**, meaning `switch` can **match and extract** object properties.  
✅ Handles **`null` values gracefully**.


### **🔹 Basic Example: Pattern Matching in `switch`**
```java
public static void process(Object obj) {
    switch (obj) {
        case String s -> System.out.println("String value: " + s.toUpperCase());
        case Integer i -> System.out.println("Integer squared: " + (i * i));
        case null -> System.out.println("Received a null value!");
        default -> System.out.println("Unknown type");
    }
}
```
👉 **No need for `instanceof` checks or casting!**  
✅ If `obj` is a `String`, it's **automatically extracted** as `s`.  
✅ If `obj` is an `Integer`, it's **assigned to `i`** without explicit casting.  
✅ `null` values are **handled explicitly**.

### **🔹 Why is this Feature Useful?**
🚀 **Improves readability**—no need for lengthy `if-else` chains.  
🚀 **Enhances type safety**—removes unnecessary casting.  
🚀 **Boosts performance**—more efficient than multiple `instanceof` checks.

### **3️⃣ Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators**
- New API for better **random number generation**.
- Supports multiple **generator algorithms** like `Xoshiro256Plus`.

**🔹 What’s New in Java 17 for Random Number Generation?**

Java 17 introduced a **modernized API for pseudo-random number generation**, 
It improving performance, flexibility, and predictability. 
This update allows developers to choose from different **algorithms** and easily manage r**andom number streams.**

**🔹 Key Features of Enhanced Pseudo-Random Generators**

✅ **New `RandomGenerator` Interface** → Unifies different random number implementations.  
✅ **Multiple Random Algorithms** → Supports new efficient algorithms beyond `java.util.Random`.  
✅ **Stream-based Random Number Generation** → Generates sequences with `ints()`, `longs()`, etc.  
✅ **Better Performance & Predictability** → Improves consistency across applications.


**🔹 Example: Using New Random API**
With Java 17, you can **choose a specific algorithm** like **Xoshiro256Plus** or **LXM**:
```java
import java.util.random.RandomGenerator;
import java.util.random.RandomGeneratorFactory;

public class RandomDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RandomGenerator random = RandomGeneratorFactory.of("Xoshiro256Plus").create();
        
        System.out.println("Random Integer: " + random.nextInt(100)); // Generates a random number within 100
        System.out.println("Random Double: " + random.nextDouble());  // Generates a random double between 0.0 and 1.0
    }
}
```
👉 **No more relying on just `java.util.Random`—you can now pick the best generator for your needs!**  

### **🔹 Why is This Useful?**
🚀 **Gives developers more control** over randomness.  
🚀 **Improves security** with predictable yet efficient randomness.  
🚀 **Provides better algorithms** than older versions (`Math.random()`).

### **4️⃣ Strong Encapsulation in `JDK` Internals**
- Restricts access to **internal APIs**.
- Improves **security and maintainability**.

### **🔹 What is Strong Encapsulation in JDK Internals?**
Java 17 **enforces stronger encapsulation** of JDK internal APIs. This means that **deep reflection on JDK internal classes is restricted**, improving security and preventing unintended dependencies on non-public components.

Before Java 17, developers could **access internal APIs** using reflection (`setAccessible(true)`), which posed security risks and led to compatibility issues across Java versions. With **strong encapsulation**, Java prevents access to these APIs by default.



### **🔹 Key Benefits of Strong Encapsulation**
✅ **Improves security** by preventing unauthorized access to internal JDK components.  
✅ **Enhances maintainability**, ensuring that only public APIs are accessible.  
✅ **Reduces reliance on undocumented classes**, which could break with Java updates.  
✅ **Encourages developers** to use official Java APIs instead of hacking into internal implementations.



### **🔹 Example: Restriction of Internal APIs**
If your code previously relied on an internal API like `sun.misc.Unsafe`, Java 17 **blocks access**:

```java
import sun.misc.Unsafe; // ❌ Restricted access

public class UnsafeDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Unsafe unsafe = Unsafe.getUnsafe(); // ❌ Throws an exception in Java 17
        System.out.println("Unsafe instance obtained: " + unsafe);
    }
}
```

👉 **In Java 17, this will fail because `sun.misc.Unsafe` is no longer accessible by default!**  


### **🔹 How to Access Restricted APIs (If Necessary)**
If you **really** need access to internal APIs, you must explicitly enable them using JVM flags:

```sh
--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED
```

This is **not recommended** for production, as it **goes against Java 17’s security principles**.

---

### **🔹 Why is Strong Encapsulation Important?**
🚀 **Prevents security vulnerabilities**, reducing attack surfaces.  
🚀 **Ensures long-term code compatibility** with future Java versions.  
🚀 **Encourages developers** to rely on standard Java APIs rather than internal hacks.  

Java 17 takes a **strict but necessary step** towards making the platform safer and more stable!

**Sealed Classes**, introduced in **Java 17**, allow developers to **control which classes or interfaces can extend or implement them**. This helps **maintain a restricted hierarchy**, ensuring only specific types can inherit from a given class.

### **Key Features of Sealed Classes:**
- **Prevents unauthorized inheritance**, improving design control.
- **Restricts subclassing**, making code more predictable.
- **Enhances security and maintainability**.

### **How to Use Sealed Classes?**
A **sealed class** must explicitly declare which classes can extend it using `permits`:

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {}

public final class Circle extends Shape {}
public final class Square extends Shape {}
```

Here:
✅ `Shape` is **sealed** and only allows `Circle` and `Square` to extend it.  
✅ `Circle` and `Square` must be either **final, sealed, or non-sealed**.

### **Types of Subclasses:**
1. **`final` class** → No further extension allowed.
2. **`sealed` class** → Can restrict its own subclasses.
3. **`non-sealed` class** → Can be freely extended.

Example of **non-sealed subclass**:
```java
public non-sealed class Rectangle extends Shape {}
```

### **Benefits of Sealed Classes**
✅ Improves **encapsulation**  
✅ Prevents **unexpected subclassing**  
✅ Helps **design stable APIs**  


Absolutely! A **real-life example** of **sealed classes** could be in a **payment processing system**, where you want to restrict the types of payments allowed.

### **Example: Sealed Classes in Payment Processing**
Imagine an **e-commerce application** where payments can only be made via **Credit Card, Debit Card, or PayPal**. You **don’t** want other types of payment subclasses being created unexpectedly.

#### **1️⃣ Define a Sealed Class**
```java
public sealed class Payment permits CreditCard, DebitCard, PayPal {
    public abstract void processPayment(double amount);
}
```
Here, `Payment` is **sealed**, and only `CreditCard`, `DebitCard`, and `PayPal` can extend it.

#### **2️⃣ Define Allowed Payment Methods**
```java
public final class CreditCard extends Payment {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing Credit Card payment: $" + amount);
    }
}

public final class DebitCard extends Payment {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing Debit Card payment: $" + amount);
    }
}

public final class PayPal extends Payment {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment: $" + amount);
    }
}
```
Here:
✅ `CreditCard`, `DebitCard`, and `PayPal` **must** extend `Payment`.  
✅ No other class can randomly extend `Payment`, keeping the system **secure and structured**.

### **3️⃣ Using the Sealed Class**
```java
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment payment = new CreditCard();
        payment.processPayment(100.0);
    }
}
```

### **Why Use Sealed Classes Here?**
✅ **Prevents unauthorized payment types**, ensuring **only valid payment methods** exist.  
✅ **Improves maintainability** by restricting subclass creation.  
✅ **Enhances security** by controlling inheritance.
