Java 17, being a **Long-Term Support (LTS)** release, introduced various improvements, making the language 
- more powerful,
- secure, and
- efficient.

Here’s a theoretical overview of its key features:
---
### 1️⃣ Sealed Classes (`sealed`, `permits`)**
- Allows **restricting, class inheritance**.
- Helps to maintain **controlled hierarchies**.
- Prevents unauthorized inheritance, improving design control.
- Restricts subclassing, making code more predictable.
- Enhances security and maintainability.

### **Types of Subclasses:**
1. **`final` class** → No further extension allowed.
2. **`sealed` class** → Can restrict its own subclasses.
3. **`non-sealed` class** → Can be freely extended.

### **Benefits of Sealed Classes**
✅ Improves **encapsulation**  
✅ Prevents **unexpected subclassing**  
✅ Helps **design stable APIs**  


- Example:
  
  ```java
  public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {}
  public final class Circle extends Shape {}
  public final class Square extends Shape {}
  ```

  ```java
  public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {}
  public final class Circle extends Shape {}
  public final class Square extends Shape {}
  ```

**Here in above example :**
  
✅ `CreditCard`, `DebitCard`, and `PayPal` **must** extend `Payment`.  
✅ No other class can randomly extend `Payment`, keeping the system **secure and structured**.

### **Why Use Sealed Classes Here?**
✅ **Prevents unauthorized payment types**, ensuring **only valid payment methods** exist.  
✅ **Improves maintainability** by restricting subclass creation.  
✅ **Enhances security** by controlling inheritance.

### 2️⃣ Pattern Matching for `switch` (Preview)**
- Simplifies `switch` statements for **complex types**.
- Supports **type patterns** in `switch` expressions.

**Pattern Matching for `switch`**, introduced as a **preview feature** in **Java 17**, 
enhances the `switch` statement by allowing more flexible type checking and pattern extraction. 
This feature simplifies complex conditional logic and improves **readability** and **efficiency**.

### **🔹 Key Benefits of Pattern Matching for `switch`**
✅ Allows **`switch` to work with objects** (not just primitives and enums).  
✅ **Removes explicit casting**, making code cleaner.  
✅ Supports **type patterns**, meaning `switch` can **match and extract** object properties.  
✅ Handles **`null` values gracefully**.


### **🔹 Basic Example: Pattern Matching in `switch`**
```java
public static void process(Object obj) {
    switch (obj) {
        case String s -> System.out.println("String value: " + s.toUpperCase());
        case Integer i -> System.out.println("Integer squared: " + (i * i));
        case null -> System.out.println("Received a null value!");
        default -> System.out.println("Unknown type");
    }
}
```
👉 **No need for `instanceof` checks or casting!**  
✅ If `obj` is a `String`, it's **automatically extracted** as `s`.  
✅ If `obj` is an `Integer`, it's **assigned to `i`** without explicit casting.  
✅ `null` values are **handled explicitly**.

### **🔹 Why is this Feature Useful?**
🚀 **Improves readability**—no need for lengthy `if-else` chains.  
🚀 **Enhances type safety**—removes unnecessary casting.  
🚀 **Boosts performance**—more efficient than multiple `instanceof` checks.

### **3️⃣ Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators**
- New API for better **random number generation**.
- Supports multiple **generator algorithms** like `Xoshiro256Plus`.

### **4️⃣ Strong Encapsulation in `JDK` Internals**
- Restricts access to **internal APIs**.
- Improves **security and maintainability**.

### **5️⃣ Deprecation & Removal**
- **Deprecated** Applet API.
- **Removed** Security Manager (`java.security.SecurityManager`).
- **Dropped** RMI Activation System.

### **6️⃣ Performance & Garbage Collector (GC) Improvements**
- **G1 GC & ZGC optimizations** for better memory efficiency.
- **Elastic Metaspace** reduces unused allocated memory.

### **7️⃣ Text Blocks Enhancement**
- Continued improvements in **multi-line string handling**.

### **8️⃣ JEP (Java Enhancement Proposals) Additions**
- Introduced **Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator)** for **native interop**.
- New **macOS/AArch64 support** for Apple Silicon.

----
**Sealed Classes**, introduced in **Java 17**, allow developers to **control which classes or interfaces can extend or implement them**. This helps **maintain a restricted hierarchy**, ensuring only specific types can inherit from a given class.

### **Key Features of Sealed Classes:**
- **Prevents unauthorized inheritance**, improving design control.
- **Restricts subclassing**, making code more predictable.
- **Enhances security and maintainability**.

### **How to Use Sealed Classes?**
A **sealed class** must explicitly declare which classes can extend it using `permits`:

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {}

public final class Circle extends Shape {}
public final class Square extends Shape {}
```

Here:
✅ `Shape` is **sealed** and only allows `Circle` and `Square` to extend it.  
✅ `Circle` and `Square` must be either **final, sealed, or non-sealed**.

### **Types of Subclasses:**
1. **`final` class** → No further extension allowed.
2. **`sealed` class** → Can restrict its own subclasses.
3. **`non-sealed` class** → Can be freely extended.

Example of **non-sealed subclass**:
```java
public non-sealed class Rectangle extends Shape {}
```

### **Benefits of Sealed Classes**
✅ Improves **encapsulation**  
✅ Prevents **unexpected subclassing**  
✅ Helps **design stable APIs**  


Absolutely! A **real-life example** of **sealed classes** could be in a **payment processing system**, where you want to restrict the types of payments allowed.

### **Example: Sealed Classes in Payment Processing**
Imagine an **e-commerce application** where payments can only be made via **Credit Card, Debit Card, or PayPal**. You **don’t** want other types of payment subclasses being created unexpectedly.

#### **1️⃣ Define a Sealed Class**
```java
public sealed class Payment permits CreditCard, DebitCard, PayPal {
    public abstract void processPayment(double amount);
}
```
Here, `Payment` is **sealed**, and only `CreditCard`, `DebitCard`, and `PayPal` can extend it.

#### **2️⃣ Define Allowed Payment Methods**
```java
public final class CreditCard extends Payment {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing Credit Card payment: $" + amount);
    }
}

public final class DebitCard extends Payment {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing Debit Card payment: $" + amount);
    }
}

public final class PayPal extends Payment {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment: $" + amount);
    }
}
```
Here:
✅ `CreditCard`, `DebitCard`, and `PayPal` **must** extend `Payment`.  
✅ No other class can randomly extend `Payment`, keeping the system **secure and structured**.

### **3️⃣ Using the Sealed Class**
```java
public class PaymentProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment payment = new CreditCard();
        payment.processPayment(100.0);
    }
}
```

### **Why Use Sealed Classes Here?**
✅ **Prevents unauthorized payment types**, ensuring **only valid payment methods** exist.  
✅ **Improves maintainability** by restricting subclass creation.  
✅ **Enhances security** by controlling inheritance.
